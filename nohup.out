Some weights of RobertaForMaskedLM were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /root/autodl-tmp/SSC/Metrics/ClozE/checkpoint/ClozE-roberta-base-cnndm and are newly initialized: ['lm_head.decoder.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
